## The initital project overview is noted below:

## Purpose
To understand the type of squirrels in Central Park, where they are located, and their behaviour at time of observation

## Data source
2018 Central Park Squirrel Census. 
This contians 3023 squirrels.
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw

## Objectives
- Number of squirrels found in the park
- Most common colour of the squirrels
- Where the squirrels were spotted (on the ground or up a tree)
- Any behaviour they were undertaking when sighted
- Location of the squirrels in the park using latitude and longitude
    - Potential filters Iâ€™m thinking about are time of sighting(AM/PM) and squirrel colour.

## High level overview
1. Data available via CSV
2. Set the data up in mongodb
3. Use Flask to create an API
4. Use Javascript to connect the api to the visualisations
